5.31

(Intro to Data Science: Coin Tossing) Modify the die-rolling simulation in
Section 5.17.2 to simulate the flipping a coin. Use randomly generated 1s and 2s to rep-
resent heads and tails, respectively. Initially, do not include the frequencies and percent-
ages above the bars. Then modify your code to include the frequencies and percentages.
Run simulations for 200, 20,000 and 200,000 coin flips. Do you get approximately 50%
heads and 50% tails? Do you see the “law of large numbers” in operation here?
