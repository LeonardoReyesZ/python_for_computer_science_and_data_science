(Intro to Data Science Challenge: Analyzing the Dice Game Craps) In this exercise,
you’ll modify Chapter 4’s script that simulates the dice game craps by using the techniques
you learned in Section 5.17.2. The script should receive a command-line argument indi-
cating the number of games of craps to execute and use two lists to track the total numbers
of games won and lost on the first roll, second roll, third roll, etc. Summarize the results
as follows:
a) Display a horizontal bar plot indicating how many games are won and how
many are lost on the first roll, second roll, third roll, etc. Since the game could
continue indefinitely, you might track wins and losses through the first dozen
rolls (of a pair of dice), then maintain two counters that keep track of wins and
losses after 12 rolls—no matter how long the game gets. Create separate bars
for wins and losses.
b) What are the chances of winning at craps? [Note: You should discover that craps
is one of the fairest casino games. What do you suppose this means?]
c) What is the mean for the length of a game of craps? The median? The mode?
d) Do the chances of winning improve with the length of the game?
