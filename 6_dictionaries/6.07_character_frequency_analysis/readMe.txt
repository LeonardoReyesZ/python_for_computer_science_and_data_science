(Character Frequency Analysis) In cryptoanalysis, the technique of character 
frequency analysis is often used to decipher a message when the key is unknown. 
This technique calculates the frequency of each character in the encrypted text 
and maps this to the frequency of characters used in, for instance, the English 
language. Write a script that uses a dictionary to summarize the frequency of each 
letter in a given text. Ignore case, ignore spaces and assume that the user does 
not enter any punctuation. Display a two-column table of the letters and their 
frequency.
