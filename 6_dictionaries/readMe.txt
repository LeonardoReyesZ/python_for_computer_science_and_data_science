(Counting Votes) Write a script that uses a dictionary to determine the number of
votes received by candidates in an election. The votes are concatenated in a string where
each vote is separated from the next by a comma. Use the techniques you learned in
Section 6.2.7. [Hint: split can take in an argument for the specific delimiter you wish to
use in a string.]
