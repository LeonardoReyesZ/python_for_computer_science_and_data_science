(Project: Cooking with Healthier Ingredients) In the “Strings: A Deeper Look”
chapter’s exercises, you’ll write a script that enables its user to enter 
ingredients from a cooking recipe, then recommends healthier replacements.
In preparation for that exercise, create a dictionary that maps ingredients 
to lists of potential replacements. Some ingredient replacements are shown below:


dictionary keys
1 cup sour cream
1 cup milk
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1 cup sugar
1 cup butter
1 cup flour
1 cup mayonnaise
1 egg
1 cup milk
1 cup oil

dictionary values -> healthier replacements
1 cup yogurt
1/2 cup evaporated milk and 1/2 cup water
1/2 teaspoon vinegar
1/2 cup honey, 1 cup molasses or 1/4 cup agave nectar
1 cup margarine or yogurt
1 cup rye or rice flour
1 cup cottage cheese or 1/8 cup mayonnaise and 7/8 cup yogurt
2 tablespoons cornstarch, arrowroot flour or potato starch or 2 egg whites or 1/2 of a large banana (mashed)
1 cup soy milk
1 cup applesauce


Your dictionary should take into consideration that replacements are not always one for
one. For example, if a cake recipe calls for three eggs, it might reasonably use six egg
whites instead. Research conversion data for measurements and ingredient substitutes 
online. Your dictionary should map the ingredients to lists of potential substitutes.
