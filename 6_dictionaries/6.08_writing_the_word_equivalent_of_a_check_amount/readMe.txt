(Challenge: Writing the Word Equivalent of a Check Amount) In check-writing
systems, it’s crucial to prevent alteration of check amounts. One common security 
method requires that the amount be written in numbers and spelled out in words as well.
Even if someone can alter the numerical amount of the check, it’s tough to change the 
amount in words. Create a dictionary that maps numbers to their corresponding word 
equivalents. Write a script that inputs a numeric check amount that’s less than 1000 
and uses the dictionary to write the word equivalent of the amount. For example, 
the amount 112.43 should be written as ONE HUNDRED TWELVE AND 43/100
